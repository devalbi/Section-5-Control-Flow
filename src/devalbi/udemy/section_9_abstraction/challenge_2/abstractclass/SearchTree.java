    -And five methods:
    -getRoot(), getter for root.
    -addItem(), same as MyLinkedList.
    -removeItem(), same as MyLinkedList.
    -performRemoval(), takes two ListItems, the item to be removed and its parent.
        It doesn't return anything and is declared as private.
        * Call this method from removeItem() when the item is found.
    -traverse(), takes the root as an argument and does not return anything.
